class Destructors{
    // Grabage collector

    // In Java, there is no explicit concept of a destructor as found in languages like C++. 
    // Instead, Java relies on an automatic memory management system known as garbage collection. 
    // This system automatically handles the allocation and deallocation of memory, 
    // ensuring that unused objects are removed from memory without requiring manual intervention by the programmer
