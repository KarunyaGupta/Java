OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 


bject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and 
classes to structure software programs. It aims to implement real-world entities like 
inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc., in programming. The main goal of OOP is to bind
 together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access 
 this data except that function



 // class is just a logical construct 
 // objects is physical reality
